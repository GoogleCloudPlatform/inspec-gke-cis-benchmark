    managed key in Cloud KMS."
    desc 'rationale', "By default, GKE encrypts customer content stored at rest, including Secrets. GKE handles
    and manages this default encryption for you without any additional action on your part.
    Application-layer Secrets Encryption provides an additional layer of security for sensitive
    data, such as user defined Secrets and Secrets required for the operation of the cluster,
    such as service account keys, which are all stored in etcd.
    Using this functionality, you can use a key, that you manage in Cloud KMS, to encrypt data
    at the application layer. This protects against attackers in the event that they manage to
    gain access to etcd."

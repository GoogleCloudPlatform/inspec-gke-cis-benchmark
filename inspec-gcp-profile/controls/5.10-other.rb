When a request to create or update a Pod does not meet the conditions in the Pod Security Policy, that request is rejected and an error is returned. The Pod Security Policy admission controller validates requests against available Pod Security Policies.

  PodSecurityPolicies specify a list of restrictions, requirements, and defaults for Pods created under the policy. See further details on recommended policies in Recommendation section 5.2."
